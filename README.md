Bonzi Buddy as a Service

---

This repository contains an attempt to reverse engineer Bonzi Buddy.

`data/` contains all the images (as PNGs) and sounds from the original, as well as Bonzi's Agent file.

`runagent/` is a simple animation viewer written in SDL.

`viewer/` is the new Qt version of runagent. Eventually it will be used as the basis for a new Bonzi Buddy.

`json/` contains convertacd, which turns the ugly text-based Agent files into regular JSON.
